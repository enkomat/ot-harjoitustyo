# you always need to import the game and the level you want to play
from util import Level_1
# then you need to initialize the level
lvl1 = Level_1()

# write your solution between the lines below
# you have the following methods to use to control the player:
# lvl1.move_player_down()
# lvl1.move_player_up()
# lvl1.move_player_left()
# lvl1.move_player_right()
# lvl1.player_interact()
# REMEMBER TO USE INTERACT TO INTERACT WITH OBJECTS
# INTERACTING IS REQUIRED TO SOLVE A LEVEL
# -------------------------------------



# -------------------------------------

lvl1.run()  # this runs the first level, always call the run method last
